## üì§ Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

1.  **Create a new GitHub Repository:**

    If you haven't already, create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `meeting-dashboard`).

2.  **Initialize Git and Push to GitHub:**

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Meeting Dashboard with Company Logo"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/meeting-dashboard.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**

    -   Go to your GitHub repository.
    -   Click on **Settings**.
    -   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    -   Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
    -   The provided `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file will automatically handle the build and deployment process whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.

4.  **Access Your Live Site:**

    Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully (this might take a few minutes), your live site will be available at:

    `https://[your-username].github.io/meeting-dashboard`

## ü§ù Sharing with Your Team

-   **Repository URL**: Share the GitHub repository link (`https://github.com/[your-username]/meeting-dashboard`) with your team members so they can clone the project, contribute, and run it locally.
-   **Live Site URL**: Share the GitHub Pages URL (`https://[your-username].github.io/meeting-dashboard`) for quick access to the live dashboard without needing to set up a local environment.

## üé® Customization

-   **Content**: Modify the `meeting1Data`, `meeting2Data`, `presentationsData`, and `actionItems` arrays in `src/App.jsx` to update the dashboard content.
-   **Styling**: Adjust Tailwind CSS classes in `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` for visual changes.
-   **Logo**: Replace `src/assets/Brain-Health-USA-Center_white-png(1).webp` with your desired logo file. Remember to update the import path in `src/App.jsx` if the filename changes.

## üêû Troubleshooting

-   If the site doesn't deploy, check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository for any workflow errors.
-   Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly (`pnpm install`).
-   Verify that the `base` path in `vite.config.js` is correctly set to `'/meeting-dashboard/'` for GitHub Pages deployment.
